# Logs

Make some logs !

# What ?

As the name suggests, it's to make logs ! Things you spent time on, for instance. I plan to add some calendar-stuff to it, so that it's got more visual-ness to it soon. But we all know what soon is 😁

# Where ?

I intended this to be a Windows app, since I hate having to use my phone or log on to a website, so in all of Flutter's glory, you can build this for Windows (I did 😅)

# How ?

I'm using Hive DB for this, which makes things so much simpler and let me build this in an afternoon ! As for state management....GetX ! The Batman of State Management in my opinon ;) Since all dependencies are native, this should run anywhere FLutter does.


Thanks for reading 🙂
